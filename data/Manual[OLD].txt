I can't be bothered to remember everything about combat. 

This manual should have all 
the relevant content I need to know.

#Equipment

<name>Equipment

<subentries>Stella; Magic Stella; Command Stella; Support Stella; Complete Stella;

<text>

There are 3 main types of equipment. Weapon, Armor, and Accessory.


Weapons primarily affect attack power and magic affinity.
They also determine the properties of your default attack.

Armor primarily affects defense and resistance.

Accessories can modify pretty much whatever and usually have special effects
that weapons and armor don't have.

<end entry>

#Stella

<name>Stella

<text>

Cosmic Remnants or Stella are refined spheres of omnee, left over from the
creation of the universe.
They contain special properties which can be used to further augment one's 
abilities.

In order to use Stella, they must be slotted into compatible equipment with 
Stellar Slots.

There are 4 known classifications for Stella.

<end entry>

#Magic Stella

<name>Magic Stella

<text>

Magic - Used to cast spells, including damaging, healing, and status-inflicting 
spells.
They can give people the ability to cast spells that they would normally be 
unable to.

Equipping a magic Stella for a spell that the user already knows has no effect.
Additionally, equipping multiple of the same Stella will not increase the 
spell's power.

<end entry>

#Command Stella

<name>Command Stella

<text>

Command - Allows the use of extra commands in battle. 
These types of Stella synergize with one's existing abilities improving their
utility and potential effectiveness in battle.

<end entry>

#Support Stella

<name>Support Stella

<text>

Support - Can be linked to other Stella in order to enhance their effects.
Note, these Stella only work with equipment with linked Stellar Slots. 
No other linking method is known.

<end entry>

#Complete Stella

<name>Complete Stella

<text>

Complete - These directly modify one's attributes. 
Utilitarian in nature, these Stella act like additional equipment, 
albeit without the bulk.

<end entry>

#Enemy Encounters

<name>Enemy Encounters

<text>

Roaming around Tricora, you may encounter wild monsters or even other people who
want you dead. Why they want you dead doesn't matter much to me, but it happens.

When runnning into a hostile entity, a battle begins whether you like it or not.

You can avoid most enemy encounters by just walking around potential enemies.

<end entry>

#Battle Screen

<name>Battle Screen

<text>

When a battle happens you should be familiar with your options.

Attack - Throw a basic attack based off your current weapon.

Generally, magic weapons such as tomes will permit the use of a magic basic attack, while
physical weapons like swords will permit the use of a physical basic attack.

Magic - Use a magic-based skill

Special - Any other skill that isn't necessarily magic.

<end entry>

#Running Away

<name>Running Away

<text>

While I do prefer going on the offensive, sometimes running is a better option.

You can do this by pressing X (or whatever the cancel button is set to) 
to contemplate running among other things.

Those other things include reviewing your condition, 
or reviewing your current party members if you have any.

#Personal Weapon Notes

<name>Personal Weapon Notes

<title>Personal Weapon Notes

<subentries> My Tome; V-Blaysers V.1;

<text>

In the situation that I do have fight something, I should always have my 
tome or the V-Blaysers with me.

In general

My tome is better at attacking dealing damage against group of enemies.
Especially if they have low resistance.

The V-Blaysers are good for exploiting enemies that are weak
to physical attacks.


<end entry>

#My Tome

<name>My Tome

<text>

This is the tome I've been using since I came down from the Light Dimension.
I'd prefer not spending money on stuff I don't need, so I just keep this 
one just in case.

It's pretty good at channeling mana and boosts my existing magic affinity 
quite a bit.
It's my go to for most monster exterminations.

<end entry>

#V-Blaysers Version 1

<name>V-Blaysers V.1

<title>V-Blaysers Version 1

<text>

I developed these myself after a pack of Terrorbats ambushed me
during a picnic. 
I'm usually pretty good at landing magic spells, but it's hard to aim
at fast moving targets like Terrorbats.
Frustrated and hungry, I came up with was a completely new weapon I call Blaysers. 
They are arm guards with carefully crafted mana channels that allow me to 
continuously stream blades of mana from my wrists. 
While these do reduce the amount of mana I have for spells, the convenience
of being able to slash things is a pretty fair trade off.

Although the blades are made of mana, they cut just like steel 
making them a good choice against enemies that are vulnerable to 
physical attacks.
